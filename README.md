# How-Close-Was-That-Election-
Is it possible to flip the election result and how easy it is to do so?

In the United States, presidential elections are determined by a majority Electoral College vote. For this problem set, weâ€™re going to see if it is possible to change the outcome of an election by moving voters around to different states. Given simplified election results dating back to 2008, your job is to find how close an election really was by finding the smallest number of voters needed to change an election outcome by relocating to another state. This is an interesting variation of the complementary knapsack problem presented in class, which we will explore more thoroughly below.
